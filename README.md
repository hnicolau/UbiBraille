UbiBraille
==========

UbiBraille is a wearable system where vibrotactile feedback allows blind users to inconspicuously and privately access textual information. Our approach draws inspiration from the traditional Braille writing mechanism where finger chords are used to input 6-dot codes (see Figure). We go one step further by using the Braille code to make sense of vibrotactile information; that is, vibrotactile stimuli are given on the fingers that are used to write a given Braille character.
